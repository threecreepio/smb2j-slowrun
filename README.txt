SMB2j Slow Run
===============

To get the latest version of the patch, check the releases:
https://github.com/threecreepio/smb2j-slowrun/releases

You can use this site to apply the IPS file to an original SMB2j ROM:
https://www.romhacking.net/patch/

A program like Lunar IPS will work just as well.

Building
--------

To build this project from source, you will need CA65 and Make.

First download the source, either using git or by downloading https://github.com/threecreepio/smb2j-slowrun/archive/master.zip and extract the archive into an empty folder.

Then place the original ROM of SMB2J in the folder named "original.fds".

Finally run the command "make" in the folder and a "main.fds" file will be created.

Good luck!
